# Context Log

This log contains the history of conversations and key decisions made during the development of the Movie Recommendation Based on Mood application.

## Initial Conversation (YYYY-MM-DD)

**User:** Provided the project specification in `MovieRecommendationSpec.markdown`.

**Gemini:** Reviewed the specification and created the initial `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files. Also added a responsive design for the mood selection buttons.

**Gemini:** Created `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `config.json` for the project.

**Gemini:** Updated `script.js` to fetch mood-to-genre mapping from `config.json`.

**User:** Provided an expanded list of moods and genres.

**Gemini:** Updated `config.json` with the new mappings and added the corresponding buttons to `index.html`.

## Recent Progress (2025-07-23)

**User:** Requested to commit and push changes.
**Gemini:** Staged `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`. Proposed a commit message for implementing core movie recommendation features.
**User:** Confirmed the commit message.
**Gemini:** Attempted to commit the changes.

**User:** Reported `Uncaught SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules`.
**Gemini:** Identified the issue as `await` being used outside an `async` function in `script.js`.
**Gemini:** Modified `script.js` to make the `click` event listener callback `async` to resolve the syntax error.

**User:** Reported "no movies are showing" and requested a review and stabilization.
**Gemini:** Identified significant code duplication in `script.js` as a potential cause for unexpected behavior.
**Gemini:** Initiated a plan to clean up `script.js` by removing redundant code blocks and then re-evaluate movie display logic and API calls.
