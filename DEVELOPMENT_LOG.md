# Development Log

This log tracks the technical progress and changes made to the codebase.

## YYYY-MM-DD

*   **Project Initialization**
    *   Created `index.html` with the basic structure of the application.
    *   Created `style.css` with initial styling for the UI components.
    *   Created `script.js` with the core logic for mood selection and API interaction.
    *   Added responsive design for mood selection buttons.
*   **Configuration and Documentation**
    *   Created `README.md` with setup and deployment instructions.
    *   Created `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
    *   Created `config.json` to store mood-to-genre mappings.
*   **Dynamic Configuration**
    *   Updated `script.js` to fetch mood-to-genre mappings from `config.json`.
*   **Expanded Moods**
    *   Updated `config.json` with an expanded list of moods and genres.
    *   Updated `index.html` to include buttons for all the new moods.

## Recent Progress (2025-07-23)

*   **Commit Attempt & Error Resolution**
    *   Attempted to commit staged changes (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`).
    *   Encountered `Uncaught SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules` in `script.js`.
    *   Resolved the syntax error by modifying the `click` event listener callback for mood buttons to be `async`.
*   **Codebase Review & Cleanup Plan**
    *   Identified significant code duplication within `script.js`.
    *   Formulated a plan to clean up `script.js` by removing redundant code blocks to improve readability and maintainability, and to stabilize application behavior.
