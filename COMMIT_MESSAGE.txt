fix: Resolve API key issue on movie details page

This commit addresses the "Invalid API key" error encountered when directly accessing the movie details page.

Key changes include:
- Ensured `window.OMDB_API_KEY` is correctly set in `movie-details.html` to prevent the API key from falling back to a placeholder.
